<h1>Strings</h1>
There are four ways to express strings:
  <ol>
  <li>A list of characters<br/><br/>
    The expression <tt>"fred"</tt> is the four bytes 'f', 'r', 'e', and
      'd'.<br/><br/>
    If used to initialize and allocate the space for a variable, four bytes will
      be allocated for the variable and the first value will be 'f'.<br/><br/>
    If used in a function, the four bytes will be pushed onto the data stack
      with the 'f' on the top of the data stack.<br/><br/>
  <li>Null-terminated (like C)<br/><br/>
    The expression <tt>N"fred"</tt> is the four bytes 'f', 'r', 'e', 'd', and
      '\0' (the null character).<br/><br/>
    If used to initialize and allocate the space for a variable, five bytes will
      be allocated for the variable and the first value will be 'f'.<br/><br/>
    If used in a function, the five bytes will be pushed onto the data stack
      with the 'f' on the top of the data stack.<br/><br/>
  <li>Counted (like Forth)<br/><br/>
    The expression <tt>C"fred"</tt> is the five bytes 4, 'f', 'r', 'e', and
      'd'.<br/><br/>
    If used to initialize and allocate the space for a variable, five bytes will
      be allocated for the variable and the first value will be 4 and the second
      value will be 'f'.<br/><br/>
    If used in a function, the five bytes will be pushed onto the data stack
      with the the number 4 on the top of the data stack and 'f' in the
      next-to-top of the data stack.<br/><br/>
  <li>Lesser-counted<br/><br/>
    The expression <tt>c"fred"</tt> is the five bytes 3, 'f', 'r', 'e', and
      'd'.<br/><br/>
    If used to initialize and allocate the space for a variable, five bytes will
      be allocated for the variable and the first value will be 3 and the second
      value will be 'f'.<br/><br/>
    If used in a function, the five bytes will be pushed onto the data stack
      with the the number 3 on the top of the data stack and 'f' in the
      next-to-top of the data stack.<br/><br/>
  </ol>
<h1>Examples</h1>
  <h2>A list of characters</h2>
    If the variable <tt>nibble_to_hex</tt> is set to the length 16
      string <tt>"0123456789ABCDEF"</tt>, then it can be used to convert a
      nibble (with a value between 0 and 15 inclusive) to the corresponding hex
      character.<br/><br/>
    The following is a function that converts a byte to its two-character hex
      representation with the most significant digit on the top of the
      stack.<br/><br/>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;.memory ROM rom<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;.varaible nibble_to_hex "0123456789ABCDEF"<br/>
    <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;.function convert_byte_to_hex<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dup 0x0F &amp; .fetchindexed(nibble_to_hex)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swap 0&gt;&gt; 0&gt;&gt; 0&gt;&gt; 0&gt;&gt; .fetchindexed(nibble_to_hex)<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;.return</tt><br/>
  <h2>Null-Terminated String</h2>
    The null-terminator in a null-terminated string can be used by a "print"
      function to terminate transmitting the string.  For example, if
      <tt>O_UART_Tx</tt> is the output port to a UART (and no status checking is
      performed), the following will send each byte of the message to the
      UART:<br/><br/>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;N"Hello World!\r\n"<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:loop .outport(O_UART_Tx) .jumpc(loop,nop) drop</tt><br/><br/>
    Note that this is equivalent to the following:<br/><br/>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;N"Hello World!\r\n"<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:loop O_UART_Tx outport drop .jumpc(loop,nop) drop</tt><br/><br/>
    The loop will transmit characters until the next character to transmit is
      the null-terminator, which has the value 0, and for which the conditional
      to the <tt>jumpc</tt> instruction will be false.  The "<tt>nop</tt>" is
      required so that the loop does not drop every other byte.  The final
      <tt>drop</tt> removes the null-terminator from the data stack.<br/>
  <h2>Counted String</h2>
    Sometimes strings to be transmitted over UARTS have null-characters embedded
      within them.  In&nbsp;this case a different method is required to
      determine whether or not the end of the string has been reached.  Forth's
      concept of a counted string can be used to resolve this.<br/><br/>
    For example, FLIR's Tau 320 camera has the following as an example sequence
      of bytes to send to the camera, which has several null bytes:<br/><br/>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;0x6E 0x00 0x00 0x08 0x00 0x02 0x0F 0x08 0x00 0x01 0x10 0x21</tt><br/><br/>
    This sequence of bytes can be sent to the camera's serial port using the
      following code:<br/><br/>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;C"\x6E\x00\x00\x08\x00\x02\x0F\x08\x00\x01\x10\x21"<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:loop swap .outport(O_UART_Tx) 1- .jumpc(loop,nop) drop</tt><br/><br/>
    Note that the count must be decremented before the conditional jump.<br/>
  <h2>Lesser-Counted Strings</h2>
    Since the count for a lesser-counted string is effectively pre-decremented,
      the preceding example can be implemented slightly more efficiently
      as:<br/><br/>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;c"\x6E\x00\x00\x08\x00\x02\x0F\x08\x00\x01\x10\x21"<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;:loop swap .outport(O_UART_Tx) .jumpc(loop,1-) drop</tt><br/><br/>
