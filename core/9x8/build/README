This directory tree has scripts to build the processor and its peripheral for
various vendor tools and fpgas.  The scripts build the process, run the vendor
synthesis tools, and run the vendor place and route tools.  The synthesis
results are extracted from the associated log files and are printed for human
analysis.

The test directories at this level are structured as vendor-fpga.

The vendortool-version-fpga directories hold make scripts that will perform the
synthesis for the commanded processor configuration for the specified FPGA
family (usually using a low-end device).  The "run" script in this directory
includes a list of versions of the tool for which the script has been tested and
a list of other versions which should also work.  The scripts assume the tools
have been installed in the "/opt/Vendor/..." directory tree as specified in the
run script.  The make script will be invoked using the specified tool set for
the specified processor configurations.

Note:  Some processor configurations will not work for specific FPGAs because of
their SRAM architecture.
