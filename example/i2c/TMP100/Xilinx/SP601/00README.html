I2C Temperature Sensor on SP601
</title>
<body>
The SP601 does not have temperature sensors.<br/><br/>
Instead, I used the SP601 and the FMC XM105 daughter board to connect to a
  seperate board with four TMP100s sensors on a 2.5&nbsp;V I2C bus.<br/><br/>
The I2C SCL signal was connected to <tt>FMC_LA19_P</tt> (pin&nbsp;38) and the
  I2C SDA signal was connected to <tt>FMC_LA19_N</tt> (pin&nbsp;40).  These
  signals were echoed to <tt>FMC_LA09_P</tt> (pin&nbsp;37) and
  <tt>FMC_LA09_N</tt> (pin&nbsp;39) respectively for examination by an
  Intronix Logicport logic analyzer.<br/><br/>
The SP601 USB UART was used to transmit the human-readable I2C temperature
  measurements to a console.<br/><br/>
