TI's TCA9554 is an 8-bit I2C I/O expander.

This example demonstrates how to use the I2C library with this chip.

                uses the J13 GPIO header for the I2C SCL and SDA signals,
                the TCA9554 interrupt signal, 3.3V power, and GND.
                Note:  The 3.3V power is OK because the Spartan-6 LVCMOS25 I/Os
                are 4.1V tolerant.
