SSBCC -- Small Stack-Based Computer Compiler
</title>
<body>
This document describes the purpose and design methodology of the Small
  Stack-Based Computer Compiler (SSBCC).<br/><br/>
The system is designed to run a Forth-like assembly.<br/><br/>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
  The purpose of the SSBCC is to generate small microcontrollers for use in
    FPGAs.  This computer compiler is designed to generate FPGA-vendor
    independent systems in either Verilog or VHDL.  The resulting micro
    controller is described by a single HDL file containing the processor core,
    the program, data stack, return stack, and variable memory.<br/><br/>
  The archive consists of the computer compiler, micro computer cores and
    assemblers, and libraries.<br/><br/>
<h1>Processor Architecture</h1>
  TODO -- RFS:  describe the general architecture<br/><br/>
<h1>8-bit Processor Example</h1>
  This section demonstrates how to generate a 8-bit processor with 9-bit wide
    instructions.  The 8-bit data width was chosen because it is characteristic
    of embedded systems controlling other processes and generating ascii output.
    The 9-bit data width was chosen because the FPGAs produced by the three
    major FPGA vendors produce memories with 8-bit data widths.<br/><br/>
  The processor is described by a regular text file with the following contents:
  <ul>
    <li>A description of the program memory, the stack memory, the return
        stack memory, the variable memory, and the I/O ports.<br/><br/>
      This part of the processor may be FPGA-dependent.  For example, Altera's
        Cyclone III FPGAs do not have distributed memory, so short memories in
        those FPGAs are either extremely inefficient or are converted into an
        M9K, in which case you ought to state that an M9K is going to be used
        anyway.  As&nbsp;another example, Xilinx' Spartan&nbsp;6 has 6-input
        LUTs that can be used as distributed memory, so a 128-word program can
        be efficiently stored in 18&nbsp;LUTs instead of occupying a precious
        Block RAM.  Additionally, if the program is between 129 and 192 words,
        i.e., it would fit in 3&nbsp;64x9&nbsp;LUTs, then the program ROM can be
        described as such, saving 9&nbsp;LUT in this case.<br/><br/>
      </li>
    <li>An instruction to load the processor core and its intrinsics.<br/><br/>
      This instruction loads the HDL instantiating processor core, i.e., its
        opcode interpretation, ALU, stack manipulation, etc.<br/><br/>
      This instruction also loads the list of Forth operations supported
        natively by the processor core and the instructions on how to construct
        the machine opcodes from those instructions.<br/><br/>
      For example, the '<tt>+</tt>' instruction is translated directly to the
        opcode <tt>0_XXXX_XXXX</tt>.<br/><br/>
      TODO -- RFS:  fill in the "X"s above.<br/><br/>
      As&nbsp;another example, the 9-bit opcodes for this particular machine use
        a leading bit of '<tt>0</tt>' to indicate that an 8-bit value is to be
        pushed onto the stack.  An&nbsp;8-bit opcode cannot put the full range
        of 8-bit values onto the stack in a single instruction.  Instead, a
        7-bit, positive value is pushed onto the stack and then, if this is
        not the desired value, an "<tt>invert</tt>" instruction immediately
        follows and is used to invert the leading bit of the of the top of the
        stack.<br/><br/>
      </li>
    <li>An optional instruction to load definitions of the remaining Forth
        instructions.<br/><br/>
      For example, a processor core could implement the Forth instructions
        "<tt>0&lt;</tt>" and "<tt>0=</tt>" and none of the remaining
        comparison operators "<tt>0&lt;=</tt>", "<tt>0&gt;</tt>",
        "<tt>0&gt;=</tt>", and "<tt>0&lt;&gt;</tt>".  The optional instructions
        would include statements like:<br/><br/>
        <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;: 0
      </li>
    </ul>
